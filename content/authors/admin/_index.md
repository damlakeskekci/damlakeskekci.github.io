I am a final-year PhD Candidate in Political Science and Sociology at the Scuola Normale Superiore in Florence. I am currently a visiting fellow at the Chair of Political Sociology and Social Policy at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin.
{style="text-align: justify;"}

Prior to my PhD I completed master's degress at Freie Universität Berlin (Sociology: European Societies) and Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin (MA Research Training Program in Social Sciences), and received my bachelor of arts in Sociology from Hacettepe University in Ankara. I have been a visiting student at the University of Gothenburg and Universität Bremen.
{style="text-align: justify;"}

In my dissertation, I investigate the transnationalisation processes of far-right mobilisations in Austria, Germany, and the United Kingdom. My research lies at the intersection of political sociology and (digital) media/communication studies. I am a mixed-methods researcher with a particular interest in text analysis and content analysis.

abstract: In this chapter, we explore how the German far right strategically uses hyperlinks on Facebook and what functions they serve. For this purpose, after gathering a sample of public Facebook pages of far-right actors from the German context (n = 100), we collected their posts dated between 2017 and 2020 (n = 120,370) using CrowdTangle and conducted a hyperlink network analysis. Our results show that the German far right on Facebook comprises a sparse unidirectional network, in line with the restrictions imposed by the platform logic of Facebook and the role far-right actors have assigned to the platform. Hyperlinks on Facebook are used generally to maintain the far-right network online, where a limited group of actors are responsible for most of the hyperlink shares. Other functions of hyperlink sharing include self-promotion and attempts to mainstream their marginalised images in society. Thus, we observe a high rate of links shared from traditional media outlets instead of alternative media sources. Future research is needed to assess the content of the shared third-party links and the user interactions with these on Facebook to determine the reception and “success” of the strategies used by far-right actors from the German context on Facebook.
